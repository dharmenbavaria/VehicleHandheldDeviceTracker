# Vehicle handheld device tracker
- The idea was to save delivery mens time if the vehicle cannot be parked or there is no road, then delivery person have to walk a bit and could consume time. So its better to use IOT devices to send location and track if vehicle and delivery person is more than 500mt we track that location of the package and next time we can use ebike to deliver that product instead of vehicle.
- I have attached my idea of how the architecture should look like in archvision.png
- I have developed in C#
- Rough design of cloudformatio template of what all components would require to have it up and running.
